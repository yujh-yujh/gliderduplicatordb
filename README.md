This is a collection of probaby and preferably* all known glider duplicators that I know of.
I'm currently just going to put glider duplicators on that list (the one that works the absolue same as the one in CGOL, aka B3/S23) not because I'm lazy, It's just too much stuff.

The database include rulespace, repeat time, duplicator minimum population(excluding the glider itself) and the duplicator itself. I'm still not sure how to mark the glider's direction, so it might often change.
